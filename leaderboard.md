#Open Hack League Leaderboard Ruleset
The goal is this document is to define how students are able to participate and earn points for themselves and their team/school.  

Below is a pre-alpha working draft, created solely to provide people with inspiration.  If you have suggestions feel free to make a PR!

###Eligible Participants
Any current student or student that has graduate within a year is eligible to earn points both for themselves and for their school.


###Eligible Events
Any student hackathon, that is open to all students is a point eligible event.  

An event does not need to be "Sponsored" or "Approved" by Open Hack League for it to award points.  As long as we have the placement data, the participants will be awarded the appropriate points.

For an event to be considered "open to all students" at least 25% of the attending students must not be from the host school.  This is to prevent host schools from gaining an unfair advantage by having events that only their students attend.


###Points
There will be both an individual leaderboard and a school leaderboard.

Points are distributed to each winning team member equally, regardless of how many people are on a team.

Schools receive points that are split up proportionately based on the affiliation distribution of the students. 

So if a team of 4, from 2 different schools, wins 1st place then each player would receive 40 Pts, but the schools would each only receive 20 Pts.



#####Hackathons
A regular hackathon is defined as being between 100 and 400 students.

1st Place: 40 Points
2nd Place: 30 Points
3rd Place: 20 Points

Category Prizes: 10 Points

#####Mega Hackathons
A Mega Hackathon is defined as being greater than 400 students.  

The points awarded are doubled.  The justification is that in larger events you are competing against more people, so placing will be more difficult and thus should be worth more.

1st Place: 80 Points
2nd Place: 60 Points
3rd Place: 40 Points

Category Prizes: 20 Points

##### <100 person hackathon?
Should they award any points at all?

####Participation Points
Arguments for:

Arguments against:

1. Existing Advantage - A school already gets an advantage by sending more people to events, because the more people you have the more likely you are to win an award.  Participation points also further advantage "host schools".
2. Differentiation - This project should try to be different than any existing hackathon leaderboards
3. Practicality - Gathering attendance data is much much harder than gathering award data
