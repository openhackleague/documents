# Open Hack League
The open source student hackathon league and leaderboards. 

##Purpose
To provide an alternative, open, hackathon league run for and by students and the community.

####Hackathon Leaderboards  

The defining feature of any league is a ranking system in which students can earn points for themselves and their team by placing at competitions.  

Designing a good leaderboard and ranking system will be the primary purpose of Open Hack League.

##Current Project Owner
[Bryan Wade](https://github.com/stale2000) -CMU graduate, software engineer in the Bay Area, and hackathon enthusiast

In the initial stages I will be the "github owner" but as soon as this gets enough traction and interest I want the project to be run by the community.
