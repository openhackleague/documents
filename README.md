# Open Hack League
The open source student hackathon league and leaderboards. 

##Purpose
To provide an alternative, open, hackathon league run for and by students and the community.  The project will be run with a focus on radical transparency and community involvement.

####Hackathon Leaderboards  

The defining feature of any league is a ranking system in which students can earn points for themselves and their team by placing at competitions.  

Designing a good leaderboard and ranking system will be the primary purpose of Open Hack League.

## Contribute!
As a community run group, anyone should feel free to submit pull requests to improve this project.

The top priority things that an MVP of Open Hack League would need are as follows:

1. A ruleset to define how students and schools are awarded points.  Including rules defining which events and participants are eligible, and how many points a given award receives.

2. A design and implementation of the leaderboard.  Included webhosting, HTML, and CSS of what the leaderboard actually looks like.

3. Data collection methods and information on which participants and school have won awards at eligible competitions so as to accurately assign them points.

##Current Project Owner
[Bryan Wade](https://github.com/stale2000) -CMU graduate, software engineer in the Bay Area, and hackathon enthusiast

In the initial stages I will be the "github owner" but as soon as this gets enough traction and interest I want the project to be run by the community.
