# Open Hack League
The open source student hackathon league and leaderboards. 

##Purpose
To provide an alternative, open, hackathon league run for and by students and the community.  The project will be run with a focus on radical transparency, community involvement, and decentralization.

The purpose is NOT to be an overarching governing organization, that provides sponsorships, makes rules, or tells you how to run your events.  Students should run their hackathons however they like.  We are only here to fill the very niche goal of promoting friendly competition and keeping score.

####Hackathon Leaderboards  

The defining feature of any league is a ranking system in which students can earn points for themselves and their team by placing at competitions.  

Designing a good leaderboard and ranking system will be the primary purpose of Open Hack League.

## Contribute!
As a community run group, anyone should feel free to submit pull requests to improve this project.

The top priority things that an MVP of Open Hack League would need are as follows:

1. A ruleset to define how students and schools are awarded points.  Including rules defining which events and participants are eligible, and how many points a given award receives.  A pre-alpha working draft can be found [here](https://github.com/stale2000/open-hack-league/blob/master/leaderboard.md).

2. A design and implementation of the leaderboard.  Included webhosting, HTML, and CSS of what the leaderboard actually looks like.

3. Data collection methods and information on which participants and school have won awards at eligible competitions so as to accurately assign them points.
