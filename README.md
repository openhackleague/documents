# Open Hack League
The open source student hackathon league and leaderboards. 

##Purpose
To provide an alternative, open, hackathon league run for and by students and the community.

##Current Project Owner
[Bryan Wade](https://github.com/stale2000) -CMU graduate, software engineer in the Bay Area, and hackathon enthusiast
In the initial stages I will be the "github owner" but as soon as this gets enough traction and interest I want the project to be run by the community.
